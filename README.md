# Mossland DAO

> *[한국어 버전](README_KR.md)*

## Mossland Vision

Mossland is building a hyper-connected world that bridges the real and virtual — from blockchain and metaverse origins to Physical AI and agentic systems. Our goal is to realize this hyper-connected technology and contribute to human society through the pursuit of our core values and mission.

## What is the Mossland DAO?

Mossland DAO is a community-driven decentralized governance framework that manages the Mossland project's ecosystem, funds, and strategic direction. MOC (Mosscoin) holders are members of the DAO and participate in proposals, discussions, and on-chain voting to shape the future of Mossland.

## Governance Platform: Agora

**Agora** is Mossland's on-chain governance platform, launched in January 2025. It was built to maximize community participation and transparency in the governance process.

- **On-chain voting** — Transparent, verifiable governance decisions recorded on Ethereum
- **Proposal submission** — Any MOC holder can submit proposals through Agora
- **Community discussion** — Open forum for deliberation before voting
- **Collaborative decision-making** — 1 MOC = 1 vote

## AI-Augmented Governance: MAIT

**MAIT** (Mossland DAO AI Toolkit) enhances governance through AI-powered analysis and support.

- **Real-time analysis** of community proposals and voting data
- **AI-assisted proposal drafting** to help authors structure and refine their proposals

## Experimental Projects

> The following projects are in **experimental** stages. Features and availability may change.

- **Algora** — AI governance analytics platform for analyzing DAO activity and trends
- **AO (Agentic Orchestrator)** — AI agent orchestration system for automated governance workflows

## MOC Token & Membership

**MOC (Mosscoin)** is an Ethereum ERC-20 token. The network migration from Luniverse to Ethereum was completed in 2025, approved through a DAO vote on Agora.

- Holding MOC = Mossland DAO membership
- 1 MOC = 1 vote
- Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) on Agora to participate

**Listed Exchanges**: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, GOPAX

## MIP (Mossland Improvement Proposal)

MIPs are the formal mechanism for proposing changes to the Mossland ecosystem. The process follows these stages:

1. **Proposal Submission** — Submit via Agora
2. **Community Discussion** — Open discussion on Agora forum
3. **Review** — Moderator/admin review
4. **On-chain Vote** — 1 MOC = 1 vote
5. **Resolution** — Majority approval = accepted
6. **Implementation**
